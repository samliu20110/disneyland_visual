Hi, I'm Sam Liu and welcome to my personal projects. 

Currently, I have displayed two of my previous projects here.

- Data Visualization project -
The data visualization project was an individual project I have finished during my stay in Monash University.
The objective is to discover and visualize the ratings of three different Disneyland Branches with reviews from Trip Advisor with over 42,000 visitors all over the world.
The coding part was finalised in R with package Shiny and Leaflet and the result visualization is interactive.
The data was obtained from Kaggle.

- Minor Thesis project -
The minor thesis project was an indivisual project during my last year in Monash University.
The project aims to discover any potential energy usage patterns (electricity, gas, and water) of an Canadian household.
The coding part applied clustering algorithm K-Means in Python as the major component of this project.
The result suggests interesting findings with monthly/seasonal patterns.
The data was obtained from Havard Dataverse.
